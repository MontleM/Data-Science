<h2>Project 1: Apple Prices Challenge</h2>
<h4>Challenge Description</h4>
Imagine you are in the Fresh Produce Industry. How much stock do you have on hand? Not too little that you run out of stock when customers want to buy more. And not too much that food waste occurs. How do you set your prices? Yields from farms fluctuate by season. Should your prices then also fluctuate by season?
With this context, EDSA is challenging you to construct a regression algorithm, capable of accurately predicting how much a kilogram of Golden Delicious Apples will cost, given certain parameters.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being able to accurately determine how much stock to have on hand and what price to set the Golden Delicious Apples to.
